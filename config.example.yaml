# Spec Recon Configuration Example
# Copy this file to 'config.yaml' and customize for your project

# Project settings
project:
  # Root directory to analyze (relative or absolute path)
  root_dir: "."
  
  # Base Java package (optional, used for package filtering)
  # Example: "com.company" will focus analysis on this package tree
  base_package: ""
  
  # Encoding hints for charset detection (tried in order)
  # Add legacy encodings if your codebase uses them
  encoding:
    - "utf-8"      # Standard UTF-8
    - "euc-kr"     # Korean (Legacy)
    - "ms949"      # Korean Windows (Legacy)

# Analysis behavior

  # Directories to exclude from analysis (glob patterns)

  # Patterns for utility classes to exclude from output
  # These classes will be filtered out from the call tree
